    <p><strong>Byzantine Generals’ Problem is defined as a situation where spread out units need to coordinate their behavior or action but cannot trust each other to get organized.</strong></p>
    <p>Byzantine describes the Byzantine Empire, this was the eastern part of Europe controlled by the Roman Empire from approximately 330 AD to 1453 AD.</p>
    <p>Byzantine Generals’ Problem is a made up, historical situation where multiple generals and their individual armies have surrounded a city to attack it. The majority of the generals must somehow coordinate a decision to either attack or retreat at
        the same time, otherwise the situation will end in a major failure.</p>
    <p><strong>The main problem preventing coordinated action is low trust. Reasons for low trust may include:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The generals are far enough apart that they cannot communicate directly or even see each other, so they must trust their messengers to deliver messages.</li>
        <li>One or more generals may be a traitor and could send false messages to the other generals.</li>
        <li>One or more messengers may be a traitor&nbsp;and could send false messages to the other generals.</li>
        <li>The enemy city may catch a messenger and send false messages.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>This Byzantine Generals Problem is commonly brought up when talking about cryptocurrencies.</strong> The digital record, known as the blockchain, must verify and record identical information simultaneously across many thousands of computers
        and none of the computers can be trusted as a reliable source.</p>
    <p><strong>Bitcoin provided a unique solution to this problem known as mining:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>All computers verify the&nbsp;maximum number of transactions that can be stored at one time.</li>
        <li>The computers then compete to solve a very complicated math problem. Their motivation is a reward in bitcoin.</li>
        <li>The first computer to solve the problem would&nbsp;not only be rewarded, they would also record the transactions into the blockchain. Included in this recording is proof that they solved the math problem.</li>
        <li>Now the winning computer sends out their updated blockchain to the other computers.</li>
        <li>The other computers quickly and easily verify that the math problem was solved and also&nbsp;verify/update their recordings.</li>
        <li>The process repeats and all computers are again trying to solve the math problem.</li>

    <p><strong>Bitcoin is defined as an early digital cash that started the cryptocurrency movement. It was created in 2009 by an unknown person or group who went by the name, Satoshi Nakamoto.</strong></p>
    <p>Bitcoin is unique because it does not rely on government/bank created money. In addition, transactions occur directly between pseudonymous people (their real names are not known), meaning there are no banks or middlemen.</p>
    <p><strong>Each transaction is recorded on a digital record kept by many people across the world known as the “blockchain”.</strong> The data on the blockchain is publicly available and stored on many computers. Because there are so many copies being
        simultaneously maintained, the transaction and banking data is very safe and virtually impossible to manipulate.</p>
    <p><strong>Individuals protect their bitcoins using their digital wallet.</strong> A wallet is software that can only be accessed by using a key, which is a long string of letters and numbers. Bitcoin’s price has risen into the thousands of dollars,
        but you can still own bitcoin by purchasing a fraction of it for dollars.</p>
    <p>Because of bitcoin’s popularity, it has become an anchor in the cryptocurrency market. That means, as the price of bitcoin goes up and down, the prices of other cryptocurrencies move too.</p>

    <p><strong>Blockchain is defined as a digital recording, used to prove that a group of people came to an agreement about something. Blockchain records are permanent and very secure, preventing manipulation. The first example of blockchain technology are the initial records of Bitcoin transactions.</strong></p>
    <p>Imagine the blockchain as a book of records. Every page in that book is a block in the blockchain. And every page could record any type of information. Blocks are created one after the other and chained together in sequence.</p>
    <p>The blockchain is very unique because it is being simultaneously created and maintained by thousands of individuals all at the same time. In other words, every single person has their own copy and they are all recording, verifying, and updating the
        data at the same time.</p>
    <p>Because blockchains don’t rely on records being kept by any single person or group, its data is very, very secure. In fact, in bitcoin’s history, there is no known instance of anyone creating counterfeit money or falsely manipulating the data.</p>
    <p>While bitcoin’s blockchain is the most famous, there are thousands of blockchains in existence. Not all blockchains are created equal.</p>
    <p>There are many factors that go into a blockchain’s speed and security. Two of the most important are the technology used and the number of users maintaining it.</p>
    <p>Blockchain technology is cloud storage on steroids. Updates are often seen in minutes or even seconds and manipulation is extremely difficult, nearly impossible.</p>
    <p>This positive quality, where many people keep do the work of maintaining their copy of the blockchain is known as “decentralized”. While many people are maintaining the blockchain, many more trust that those who are doing the work are honest.</p>
    <p>Blockchains can be used to record all sorts of information including digital art and music, medical records, who manufactured a physical product and much more.</p>
    <p>If a blockchain’s data is not distributed among many individuals and instead run by one government, organization, group or person, then it is not at a blockchain at all. A system with a central source is simply a database.</p>

    <p><strong>Bubble is a large increase in prices for the whole economy or a part of the economy, followed by a massive, rapid drop.</strong></p>
    <p>It’s important to notice that a bubble is only a bubble if it applies to an entire economy or part of the economy. If the massive price swings are just between you and your circle of friends, it’s probably not a bubble.</p>
    <p>Famous historical examples of bubbles are the Dutch Tulip bubble of the 1630s, the Dot-Com bubble of the 1990s, the housing bubble of the early 2000s and some like to say the Bitcoin bubble of 2017.</p>
    <p><strong>Let’s first look at the definition of “natural price”</strong>. Natural price is an amount of money being charged, set by the cost of producing a product. For example, if it costs $3.00 to produce 12 duck eggs, than the natural price is $3.00.</p>
    <p>If demand goes up from unreasonable, unnatural causes, then prices will shoot up.</p>
    <p><strong>Here’s a ridiculous example of a bubble with duck eggs:</strong></p>
    <p>Let’s imagine that Joe buys 12 duck eggs every week from a duck farmer for $5. Under normal circumstances, the price will probably stay fixed at $5. But then let’s say the Kardashians tell the world they love duck eggs and themselves eat 3 every single
        day!
    </p>
    <p>Suddenly millions of people also want duck eggs and the duck farmer is overwhelmed with of customers asking for his eggs. When Joe asks the farmer for his usual 12 eggs for $5, Bill who watched the Kardashians offers more money for those same eggs.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Joe offers $10 for 12 eggs.</li>
        <li>Alice hears Bill’s offer and wants the eggs even more and offers $20.</li>
        <li>Susy hears Alice’s offer and offers a massive $50. In minutes, those $5 eggs are worth 10X at $50!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Several weeks later, the Kardashians and their friends don’t care about duck eggs. Silly Susy may have stocked up on hundreds of eggs, but now the Kardashians don’t care and neither does she. Susy begins to sell her duck eggs and the price of duck
        eggs drops rapidly.</p>
    <p>Now Joe can continue buying his duck eggs for $5. The bubble has popped.</p>
    <p><strong>Prices only go up for two reasons:</strong> an increase in demand as we’ve seen above ora decrease in supply.</p>
    <p>If the farmer’s ducks always make 24 eggs each week but this week they only make 12, the farmer could charge Joe more than $5 simply because they both want those 12 eggs.</p>
    <p><strong>By definition, a bubble must burst, if it doesn’t, then it wasn’t a bubble to begin with.</strong></p>

<div *ngIf="Candlesticks">
    <h1 class="entry-title main_title">{{this.title}}</h1>
    <p><strong>Candlesticks are defined as a representation on a chart used to show changes in price over time. Each candle provides 4 points of information, the opening price, the closing price, the high, and the low. Also known as ‘candles’ and ‘Japanese candlesticks’.</strong></p>
    <p>The Japanese developed this type of chart hundreds of years ago while trading rice and so it was named after them. Today, many investors prefer candles because they are easy to understand and provide a lot of quick information.</p>
    <p>Candles have two parts, the body (it can be hollow or filled) and the long thin lines drawn above and/or below. The lines are also called “wicks”, “shadows”, or “tails”.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The body is used to show the opening and closing price for that time period.</li>
        <li>The wicks are used to show the highest price and lowest price reached for that time period.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Candles are often red or green, where red indicates a price started high and ended low and green indicates a price that started low and ended high. Some candles are black and white, where black indicates a price that started high and ended low and
        white indicates a price that started low and ended high.</p>
    <p>Candles represent a single time period. For example, if you are looking at a 1 hour chart, each candle represents 1 hour of trades.</p>
    <p>Some candles&nbsp;are long and some candles are short. Long candles tell you there was a lot of pressure to buy or sell and short candles tell you there was very little pressure.</p>

    <p>Most CPUs are a small, black square with many tiny metal wires on the bottom side.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The CPUs are usually what we describe when talking about computer speed. This speed, also called clock speed, is measured in gigahertz or GHz for short. If a CPU had a clock speed of 1 hertz, it could do 1 very simple task every second.</p>
    <p>Most smartphones today have processors that measure more than 1 GHz. A 1 GHz processor can handle more than 1 billion tasks every second.</p>
    <p>In addition to clock speed, the number of CPUs can affect the speed and power. The more CPUs a computer has, the more tasks it can process.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 CPU = Single core processor</li>
        <li>2 CPU = Dual core processor, it can handle twice as much as a single core.</li>

<div *ngIf="Confirmation">
    <h1 class="entry-title main_title">{{this.title}}</h1>
    <p><strong>Confirmation is defined as a type of proof that a transaction was recorded and verified on the blockchain. The higher number of confirmations, the more trusted that transaction is.</strong></p>
    <p>A blockchain can be compared to a digital book that can record anything where each page in that book is known as a block. The blockchain is simultaneously maintained by a network of computers who must all agree on the data.</p>
    <p><strong>The first confirmation comes when a block records your data. Every block recorded afterwards is counted as an additional confirmation.</strong></p>
    <p>Any bad actor who wants to manipulate the blockchain would need to have at least 51% of the computing power of the entire network to make changes. In a big blockchain like bitcoin, that’s incredibly expensive and difficult.</p>
    <p>After sending data to the blockchain, you have to wait for one of the computers maintaining the network to record and verify your data into a block. Because blocks are connected to each other, every block confirms all prior blocks. That means the
        longer the blockchain gets, the more secure earlier blocks are.</p>
    <p>When using bitcoin, it is recommended you wait for at least 6 confirmations (5 blocks recorded after yours) before considering your transaction is permanent. After 6 blocks, there is less than a 0.1% chance your data will ever be altered.</p>

    <h1 class="entry-title main_title">{{this.title}}</h1>
    <p><strong>Cryptocurrency is an electronic money that uses technology to control how and when it is created and lets users directly exchange it between themselves, similar to cash.</strong></p>
    <p>Crypto- is short for “cryptography”, and cryptography is computer technology used for security, hiding information, identities and more. Currency simply means “money currently in use”.</p>
    <p>Cryptocurrencies are a digital cash designed to be quicker, cheaper and more reliable than our regular government issued money. Instead of trusting a government to create your money and banks to store, send and receive it, users transact directly
        with each other and store their money themselves.</p>
    <p>Because people can send money directly without a middleman, transactions are usually very affordable and fast.</p>
    <p>To prevent fraud and manipulation, every user of a cryptocurrency can simultaneously record and verify their own transactions and the transactions of everyone else.</p>
    <p>In the real world, a book used to record transactions is called a ledger. And so it is with this digital money. But unlike in the real world, with cryptocurrencies, anyone can keep their own complete copy of this ledger.</p>
    <p>Because the data is public and maintained by many thousands of people, transactions are permanent and very secure.</p>
    <p>With public records, cryptocurrencies don’t require you trust a bank to hold your money. They don’t require you trust the person you are doing business with to actually pay you. Instead, you can actually see the money being sent, received, verified,
        and recorded by thousands of people. This system requires no trust. This unique positive quality is known as “trustless”.</p>

    <p>There are many types of cryptography including hiding words in images, using micro dots and computer programs. With cryptocurrencies, we hide money and the people who sent them in a scrambled, unreadable form.</p>
    <p>The information can be unlocked and made readable using a code also known as a key. The key is made up of a string of letters and numbers.</p>

    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Year 2038 problem</strong>&nbsp;relates to representing time in many digital systems as the number of seconds passed since&nbsp;1 January 1970&nbsp;and storing it as a&nbsp;signed 32-bit binary integer. Such implementations cannot
        encode times after 03:14:07 UTC on 19 January 2038. The Year 2038 problem is caused by insufficient&nbsp;capacity&nbsp;of the chosen&nbsp;storage unit.</p>
